This is repo based on the work I did for my master thesis on ruled surfaces in 2015 at the University of Copenhagen. 

It will contain the following set of fundamental NURBS algorithms: 

	- degree elevation
	- knot insertion/removal
	- knot refinement

and an algorithm for defining a ruled surface (NURBS) by connecting any two NURBS curves with straight lines.
