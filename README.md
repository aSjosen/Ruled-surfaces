This is repo based on the work I did for my master thesis on ruled surfaces in 2015 at the University of Copenhagen. It will contain 3 types of algorithms:

  1. Algorithms for constructing ruled surfaces from a set of input curves.
  2. Algorithms for segmenting a CAD surface into regions that are well-approximated by ruled surfaces.
  3. Algorithms for approximating CAD surfaces by ruled surfaces.
